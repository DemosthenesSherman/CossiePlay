 <p><strong>Welcome to CossiePlay, where costumes are made with you in mind. </strong></p>
   <p>Operating in Hulkstown since 2012, CossiePlay is a family-run business that is truly based on the idea of "customer satisfaction". </p>

   <p>Steven Rogers, a former Navy Seal, gained interest in hosting parties after 37 years of serving his country. He knows that life is short, which is why he looks forward to helping people live out their fantasies at every family-friendly CosParty that's held.</p>

   <p> Sally Rogers didn't waste any time with her interest in the costume business, as she was already designing and sewing elaborate ball gowns after 6 weeks in her first dress designing course. 10 years later, she's making even more elaborate, impressive and irrevocably beautiful costumes that this small business is know for. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Together, their primary goal is to expand the joy and intrigue of cosplay to more people each day. Of course, that's not assuming that cosplay isn't already booming at this point, since it has been a hobby since the 1990's. Since it involves people representing certain characters in venues apart from a stage/set, this activity became a significant part of Japanese, Asian, and Western culture. Apart from conventions, dedicated competitions as a certain fall costumed holiday exhibits cosplaying in one form or another.</p>
 <p>Therfore, you can see why Mr. and Mrs. Rogers are dedicated to making and buying some of the best costumes on the market as well as hosting one of the best costumed parties in Hulkstown; they want to be able to maginfy the popularity of this activity, eventually making it more timeless and fun one customer at a time. </p>
