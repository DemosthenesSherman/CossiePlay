  <p>Operating in Hulkstown since 2012, CossiePlay is a family-run business run by Steve and Sally Rogers. Their primary goal is to expand the joy and intrigue of cosplay to more people each day. Of course, that's not assuming that cosplay isn't already booming at this point, which it is.</p>
  <p>You see, "cosplay" has been a hobby since the 1990's! It involves many people wearing costume to represent a certain character in venues apart from a stage/set. This activity became a significant part of Japanese, Asian, and Western culture as this activity isn't only seen in conventions, but also in dedicated competitions and on a certain time of the year that is dedicated to giving costumed kids candy at night.</p>
  <p>Therfore, you can see why Mr. and Mrs. Rogers are dedicated to making and buying some of the best costumes on the market as well as hosting one of the best costumed parties in Hulkstown; they want to be able to maginfy the popularity of this activity, eventually making it more timeless and fun one customer at a time. </p>
